# co-promise
co-promise for JavaScript

# Installing

```bash
$ npm install co-promise
```

# Getting starter

```js

let CoPromise = require( 'co-promise' )
```
# Usage

Create

```js

//the generator are called with a arg and next, what is the next generator
let gen1 = function*(resolve, reject) {
  // every generator is wrapper with co
  let res = yield Promise.resolve(4)
  assert.equal(res, 4)
    //this promise is resolved with 6
  let dist = Math.random()
  if (dist > 0.5) {
    resolve(dist)
  } else if (dist < 0.2) {
    reject(dist)
  } else {
    throw 'hola'
  }
}
CoPromise(gen1)
.then(function*(res) {
    let _res = yield Promise.resolve(res)
    assert(_res > 0.5) // true
    done()
  })
  .catch(function*(_error) {
    let error = yield Promise.resolve(_error)
    assert(error === 'hola' || error < 0.2) // true
    done()
  })
```
### `Class Co-promise`
#### `Co-promise(Generator,[thisArg])`
To instance the co-promise you pass the Generator to be iterated and a thisArg to be used

### `Class Co-promise`

#### Co-promise.reject(error) => CoPromisesRejected
#### Co-promise.resolve(res) => CoPromisesResolved
#### Co-promise.all(arrayPromises) => CoPromisesResolvedWithArrayPromises

### `Instance Co-promise method`
#### `co-promise.then(resHandler[,rejHandler])`
This method is like the ordinary promises, but resHandler and rejHandler are Generators, return a co-promise.

#### `co-promise.catch(rejHandler)`
This method is like the ordinary promises, but  rejHandler are Generators, return a co-promise.

#### `co-promise.ctx`
thisArg passed to every generator, this is the same passed to constructor like thisArg and can be
upgraded at any time.

# Testing

npm test
```
